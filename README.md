# 📐 Polynomial Processor (C++)

This project is a C++ application that performs polynomial operations using the **singly linked list** data structure. It was developed as part of a coursework assignment.

## 🧱 Data Structure Used

Polynomials are represented using a **singly linked list**, where each node contains a coefficient and an exponent. This structure allows for dynamic creation, manipulation, and evaluation of polynomials.

## ✨ Features

- Polynomial creation (from string expressions)
- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials
- Evaluation of a polynomial at a specific `x` value
- Derivative calculation
- ASCII-based graphical plotting in the terminal

## 🗃️ Files

- `PolyNode.h` – Definition of the polynomial node (coef, exp, next)
- `Poly.h` – Function prototypes
- `poly.cpp` – Implementation of all polynomial operations
- `main.cpp` – Test functions and sample outputs

When the program runs, 8 test cases are executed automatically in sequence.

### 📌 Note
This project was developed as a homework assignment for a data structures course. The use of linked lists was specifically required.
